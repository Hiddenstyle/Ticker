# Ticker.js

Small experiment on how to build a basic gale loop utility for easy access to a continuous uppdate event on the window object.

Feel free to comment and come with ideas on how to improve!

This is a hobby project so i am probably not going to be super active on this project - it is more for me getting back on the horse. :)

Gonna be exploring some of the ideas form Isaac Sukins article on javaScript game loops and timing:

Maybe i'll find something usefull.

Have a great day!
